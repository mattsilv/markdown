This test verifies proper rendering of various text formatting options.

## Test Input

**Bold text**

*Italic text*

***Bold and italic text***

Horizontal rule:

```

## Expected Behavior

- Normal text should appear in the standard font and weight
- Bold text should appear with heavier font weight
- Italic text should appear slanted
- Bold and italic text should have both a heavier weight and be slanted
- Strikethrough text should have a line through it
- Inline code should appear in a monospace font
- Blockquotes should be visually distinct (e.g., indented or with a border)
- The horizontal rule should create a visible dividing line across the page
